  "My journey began four years ago in Kyrgyzstan on a hot summer afternoon. Inside the IT classroom, the air conditioner hummed loudly, sending a cold breeze across the room. Despite the chill, I felt a kind of heat inside me: stress, confusion, frustration. I remember glancing around as my classmates typed confidently, their keyboards clicking like they knew exactly what they were doing. Meanwhile, the code on my own screen felt like a foreign language.",

On the last day, after the teacher packed up and left, I stayed seated. The classroom felt too quiet. My hands were cold, and I remember whispering to myself, “Why don’t I understand this yet?” That moment of disappointment stung deeply but it also transformed into something else. Determination. For the first time, I realized that waiting for someone to teach me was not enough. If I wanted to learn, I had to do it myself.",

When I found a playlist promising to teach everything from beginner to advanced, I pressed Play this time with a different mindset. I didn’t simply watch; I paused, rewound, typed, deleted, and tried again. I filled notebooks with code snippets, explanations, and questions. My handwriting became messy with arrows, highlights, and small discoveries. Over time, these notebooks became my personal archive of knowledge, proof that I could rely on my own effort. It was the first time I felt ownership over my learning, and that changed how I saw myself not just as a student, but as someone capable of building skills on his own.",

English felt like entering a completely new world. I remember sweating in the heat of the island, the sun pressing against the window as I tried to memorize new words. When the heat became unbearable, I finally turned on the air conditioner. The cool air washed over me, and suddenly my mind felt clearer. That small sensory moment taught me something unexpected: the environment shapes the mind. By improving my surroundings even slightly I could learn better."

"Cyprus was the first place where I truly studied alone. No one interrupted me. No one told me to stop. I realized that all my earlier struggles had taught me how to learn: how to choose the right materials, how to filter information, how to stay patient, and how to believe in slow progress. With each word I learned, with each sentence I practiced, I felt my confidence grow. Over time, I began to imagine a future where English was not a barrier but a bridge one that could lead me to new countries, new knowledge, and new opportunities."

"One memory from my childhood often returned to me during these moments. At family dinners, my relatives would talk about people who achieved success through hard work. I can still hear my uncle saying, “No teacher can give you everything you must search for knowledge yourself.” As a child, I didn’t understand it deeply, but those conversations stayed in my mind. When I sat in front of that YouTube playlist years later, I finally understood. I had become the character in those stories, the person staying up late, working steadily toward a dream."

"Learning English opened possibilities I once thought were impossible. The simplest joy was understanding movies without dubbing, hearing every emotion in the actor’s real voice. But the biggest opportunity was pursuing higher education in the United States. When I was accepted to CSUN, I remembered the boy in the cold classroom in Kyrgyzstan who couldn’t understand a line of code. Now I am writing essays in English, something I once thought would take a lifetime."
